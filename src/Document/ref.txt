step-1  basic design in which h1 tag and form and a div to show result

step-2 create a state  let [city, setCity] = useState('') and input box value pass city and setCity will pass the value to the function

step-3 search button ...create a function get data then only fetch the data form api

step-4  create another state let [weatherDetails, setweatherDetails] = useState() intial is usestate empty to show the result in the result box

step-4 in result box do some modification set a condition if weatherDetails variable is !==undefined ,
then show the result otherwise show no data found

step-5 in gerData function from api we check that when we enter city those have not exit then give cod=404 so set the condition if city not exit 
then pass undefied to the setweatherDetails function otherwise show data

step-6 now some time we know response is given to take some time so we create a loding gfg to show 

so we create a another satate  and a image of loading and initial hidden 
when getData function call  setIsloading function true and after output setIsloading is false
